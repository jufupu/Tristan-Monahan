Portfolio 

A collection of my own work in one place. Mix of Javascript, React, Angular, Vue, Threejs work.

Included in this porfolio is three apps I built in three different Javascript frameworks for my final Hons project where i studied the accessbility of those frameworks and wrote a comparative study ont them.

Also some passion projects including a food ordering app I built in React.js and a wordle clone I built in plain Javascript because why not :) 

Please enjoy.
